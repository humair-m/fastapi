  "text": "An atom is the fundamental building block of all matter in the universe. It is the smallest unit of an element that retains the chemical properties of that element. Atoms are composed of three primary subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons carry a positive charge, neutrons are neutral, and electrons carry a negative charge. The protons and neutrons are densely packed in the nucleus at the center of the atom, while the electrons orbit the nucleus in defined regions known as electron shells or orbitals. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the atomic number, which identifies the element. For example, hydrogen has one proton, while carbon has six. Electrons determine the atomâ€™s reactivity and how it will interact or bond with other atoms. The arrangement of these electrons in shells influences chemical bonding, such as covalent and ionic bonds. Neutrons contribute to the atomic mass and stability of the nucleus. Different versions of the same element with varying numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. While atoms are incredibly small, they are composed of even smaller particles called quarks and gluons, which make up the protons and neutrons. Atoms can bond together to form molecules, which are the basis for all the substances we see and use. For instance, water is a molecule made from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The understanding of atoms has evolved significantly over time, from the indivisible units imagined by the ancient Greeks to the complex, structured systems described by quantum mechanics today. This ongoing study has enabled innovations in medicine, technology, and energy. Mastery of atomic theory underpins modern chemistry, physics, and material science, shaping the very fabric of our understanding of the universe.",
